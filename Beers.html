  <h1>PORTERS</h1>
  <p class="first-letter">
    What the Hell is a Porter? Porter is said to have been populare with transportation workers of Central London, hence the name. Most traditional British brewing documentation from the 1700s state that porter was a blend of three different styles; an old ale (stale or soured), a new ale (brown or pale ale) and a weak one (mild ate), with various combinations of blending and staleness. The end result was also commonly known as "Entire Butt" or "Three Threads" and had a pleasing taste of neither new nor old. It was the first truly engineered beer, catering to the buplics taste, playing a critical role in quenching the thirst of the UKs Industrial Revolution adn lending an arm in building the mega-breweries of today.
Our porters pour silky black with a creamy tan head. The nose is sweet with strong chocolate and caramel malt presence. No absence of hops gives Witches' Brew robust porter the full flavor you deserve and expect. Cozylike velvet. It's a good brew with which to admire the moon.

  <h1>ALES</h1>
  <p>Ales are brewed with a top-ferminting yeast that thrives at mid-range room temperatures. For this reason, ales are typically stored between 60 degrees and 75 degrees Fahrenheit during the fermentation stage. This type of yeast and the fermentation temperature tend to give ales a fruitier and spicier flavor than lagers. In general, ales are more robust and complex.

Its unique piney and grapefruit aromas from the use of whole-cone American hops have fascinated beer drinkers for deades and made this beer a classic, yet it reamins new, complex and surprising to thousands of beer drinkers everyday. It is, as it always has been, all natural, bottle conditioned and refreshingly bold.</p>

  <h1>STOUTS</h1>
  <p>
  Have you ever wondered why draught stout seems creamier and the head thicker than bottled stout? Even the most casual beer drinker can notice the difference. A well pulled draught stout should be creamy with a thick, persistent head while stout from bottle will seem more bubbly and less silky with a shorter lived head, and who wants that? This is because draught beer is infused with beer gas, a blend of nitrogetn and carbon dioxide, while bottled beer is carbonated with carbon dioxide alone.

  The coffee lover's consummate beer. Brewed with an abundance of flaked oats, bitter and imported chocolates, and Sumatra and Kona coffe, this stout has an intense fresh-roasted java nose topped with a frothy, cinnamon-colored head that goes forever. And who knows what spell we may have added! Maybe is will help you go forever...</p>
