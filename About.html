  About The "Brew Crew"</h1>
    <p> Witches' Brew is brought to you by the Salem famlily of Norfolk, Virginia. They have been creating tasty brews for generations, so they know a thing or two about making a good brew.

After a long day of working at the Lair, a.ka. the brewery, we found that one inevitably gets tired. So we thought, "What better way to wind down a long day than to sip a cold brew?" Of course, we wouldn't settle for just any ordinary beer. So instead, we sought out the best brewmeister we could find and issued a challenge: Brew us a beer so great that it will put a spell on you. We didn't expect him to take that challenge literally, but that is what he did. He went out and bought a few books on witchcraft and went to work.

We would have preferred to let the original brew master say a few words in this space, but unfortunately, he was so exstatic after tasting his life's piece de resistance, that he mixed up his words and uttered a mistaken spell that cast him...we know not where.
